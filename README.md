### Repository Structure
This repository organizes different programming assignments from my first semester into individual folders for each subject. Each folder contains a README with an overview and details of the key tasks performed. The structure is designed to showcase a progression of skills in data analysis, machine learning, and deep learning. All projects done by me, all summaries done by ChatGPT.

### Programming in Python I 
First semester course.

Covered basic Python operations, control structures, file handling, and object-oriented programming before progressing to more advanced concepts using libraries like os, pickle, csv, multiprocessing, re, subprocess and NumPy. Key topics included list and matrix manipulation, recursion, object hierarchies, file I/O, and data transformations. Later assignments introduced array extensions, one-hot encoding, element-wise function application, and moving averages with NumPy.

This collection showcases fundamental programming skills, transitioning to more complex data manipulation using numerical libraries.

### Supervised Machine Learning

Third semester course.

This course focused on building a deep understanding of key supervised learning techniques, with an emphasis on mathematical foundations and practical applications. Topics included k-nearest neighbors (k-NN), logistic regression, support vector machines (SVMs), decision trees, and ensemble methods such as AdaBoost. The course also explored bias-variance decomposition, constrained optimization, and the use of PyTorch for building neural networks. Throughout the course, assignments emphasized model evaluation, risk calculation, and error analysis, incorporating visualization techniques to interpret model performance. The assignments were implemented using Python, leveraging libraries such as NumPy, Scikit-learn, and PyTorch for computational efficiency.

This collection demonstrates proficiency in supervised learning algorithms, with a focus on both theoretical understanding and practical model implementation.
